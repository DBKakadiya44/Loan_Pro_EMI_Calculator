Additionally, some plans also cover the cost of treatment undertaken at home, prior to a hospitalization or after discharge from the same. \n\n✤ With the rising medical inflation in India, buying health insurance has become a necessity. However, before proceeding with your purchase, consider the various types of health insurance plans available in India. \n\n✤ Types of Health Insurance policies \n\n✤ There are eight main types of health insurance policies available in India. They are: \n\n✤ Individual Health Insurance - These are healthcare plans that offer medical cover to just one policyholder.\n\n✤ Family Floater Insurance - These policies allow you to avail health insurance for your entire family without needing to buy separate plans for each member. Generally, husband, wife and two of their children are allowed health cover under one such family floater policy.\n\n✤ Critical Illness Cover - These are specialized health plans that provide extensive financial assistance when the policyholder is diagnosed with specific, chronic illnesses. These plans provide a lump-sum payout after such a diagnosis, unlike typical health insurance policies. \n\n✤ Senior Citizen Health Insurance - As the name suggests, these policies specifically cater to individuals aged 60 years and beyond.\n\n✤ Group Health Insurance - Such policies are generally offered to employees of an organization or company. They are designed in such a way that older beneficiaries can be removed, and fresh beneficiaries can be added, as per the company’s employee retention capability.\n\n✤ Maternity Health Insurance - These policies cover medical expenses during prenatal, post-natal and delivery stages. It covers both the mother as well as her newborn. \n\n✤ Personal Accident Insurance - These medical insurance policies only cover financial liability from injuries, disability or death arising due to accidents.\n\n✤ Preventive Healthcare Plan - Such policies cover the cost of treatment concerned with preventing a severe disease or condition. \n\n✤ Benefits of Health Insurance \n✤ After assessing the various kinds of health insurance available, you must be wondering why availing such a plan is essential for you and your loved ones. Look at the reasons listed below to understand why. \n\n✤ Medical Cover - The primary benefit of such insurance is that it offers financial coverage against medical expenditure. \n\n✤ Cashless Claim - If you seek treatment at one of the hospitals that have tie-ups with your insurance provider, you can avail cashless claim benefit. This feature ensures that all medical bills are directly settled between your insurer and hospital. \n\n✤ Tax Benefits - Those who pay health insurance premiums can enjoy income tax benefits. Under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act one can avail a tax benefit of up to Rs.1 Lakh on the premium payment of their health insurance policies. \n\n✤ There may be additional advantages, depending on the insurance provider in question.");

Motor insurance can be availed for three categories of motorized vehicles, including: \n\n✤ Car Insurance - Personally owned four-wheeler vehicles are covered under such a policy. \n\n✤ Two-wheeler Insurance - Personally owned two-wheeler vehicles, including bikes and scooters, are covered under these plans. \n\n✤ Commercial Vehicle Insurance - If you own a vehicle that is used commercially, you need to avail insurance for the same. These policies ensure that your business automobiles stay in the best of shapes, reducing losses significantly. \n\n✤ Types of Motor Insurance Policies\n\n✤ Based on the extent of cover or protection offered, motor insurance policies are of three types, namely: \n\n✤ Third-Party Liability - This is the most basic type of motor insurance cover in India. It is the minimum mandatory requirement for all motorized vehicle owners, as per the Motor Vehicles Act of 1988. Due to the limited financial assistance, premiums for such policies also tend to be low. These insurance plans only pay the financial liability to the third-party affected in the said mishap, ensuring that you do not face legal hassle due to the accident. They, however, do not offer any financial assistance to repair the policyholder’s vehicle after accidents. \n\n✤ Comprehensive Cover - Compared to the third-party liability option, comprehensive insurance plans offer better protection and security. Apart from covering third party liabilities, these plans also cover the expenses incurred for repairing the damages to the policyholder’s own vehicle due to an accident. Additionally, comprehensive plans also offer a payout in case your vehicle sustains damage due to fire, man-made and natural calamities, riots and other such instances. Lastly, you can recover your bike’s cost if it gets stolen, when you have a comprehensive cover in place. One can also opt for several add-ons with their comprehensive motor insurance policy that can make it better-rounded. Some of these add-ons include zero depreciation cover, engine and gear-box protection cover, consumable cover, breakdown assistance, etc.\n\n✤ Own Damage Cover - This is a specialized form of motor insurance, which insurance companies offer to consumers. Further, you are eligible to avail such a plan only if you purchased the two-wheeler or car after September 2018. The vehicle must be brand new and not a second-hand one. You should also remember that you can avail this standalone damage cover only if you already have a third party liability motor insurance policy in place. With its own damage cover, you basically receive the same benefits as a comprehensive policy without the third-party liability portion of the policy. \n\n✤ Benefits of Motor Insurance Policies \n\n✤ Cars and bikes are increasingly more expensive with each passing day. At such a time, staying without proper insurance can lead to severe monetary losses for the owner. Listed below are some advantages of purchasing such a plan. \n\n✤ Prevents Legal Hassle - Helps you avoid any traffic fines and other legalities that you would otherwise need to bear.\n\n✤ Meets All Third-Party Liability - If you injure a person or damage someone’s property during a vehicular accident, the insurance policy helps you meet the monetary losses, effectively. \n\n✤ Financial Assistance to Repair Your own Vehicle - After accidents, you need to spend considerable sums on repairing your own vehicle. Insurance plans limit such out of pocket expenses, allowing you to undertake repairs immediately.\n\n✤ Theft/loss cover - If your vehicle is stolen, your insurance policy will help you reclaim a portion of the car/bike’s on-road price. You can expect similar assistance if your vehicle is damaged beyond repair due to accidents. \n\n✤ Additionally, individuals who own a commercial car/two-wheeler can also avail tax benefits if they pay premiums for that vehicle.");

Such policies ensure the financial safety of a traveler during a trip. Therefore, when compared to other insurance policies, travel insurance is a short-term cover. \n\n✤ Depending on the provider you choose, travel insurance may offer financial aid at various times, such as during loss of baggage, trip cancellation and much more. Here is a look at some of the different types of travel insurance plans available in the country: \n\n✤ Domestic Travel Insurance - This is the kind of travel insurance policy that safeguards your finances during travels within India. However, if you plan to step outside the country for a vacation, such a policy would not offer any aid. \n\n✤ International Travel Insurance - If you are stepping out of the country, ensure you pick an international travel insurance plan. It allows you to cover the unforeseen expenses that can arise during your trip like medical emergencies, baggage loss, loss of passport, etc. \n\n✤ Home Holiday Insurance - When you are traveling with family, your home remains unguarded and unprotected. Chances of burglary are always significant, which may lead to significant losses. Thankfully, with home holiday insurance plans, which are often included within travel policies, you are financially protected from such events as well. \n\n✤ Benefits of Travel Insurance \n\n✤ The following aspects are covered under travel insurance plans: \n\n✤ Cover Flight Delay - Flight delays or cancellations can lead to significant losses for the passenger. If you buy travel insurance, you can claim such financial losses from the insurer. \n\n✤ Baggage Loss/Delay - Travel insurance lets you claim monetary assistance if there is a delay or you happen to lose your luggage during the trip. With this amount, you can purchase some of the necessary items. \n\n✤ Reclaim Lost Travel Documents - Visa and passport are essential documents during an international trip. Opting for international travel insurance ensures that you have the necessary financial backing to reapply for interim or replacement documents as and when necessary. \n\n✤ Trip Cancellation Cover - A sudden death in the family or a medical emergency may play spoilsport with your travel arrangements. Thankfully, international travel insurance plans support trip cancellations in such events. You can claim financial assistance to pay penalties and cancellation charges for flights, hotels, etc. \n\n✤ Make sure that you choose an insurer carefully, especially a company that is reliable and available 24x7 to assist you.");

Whether the liability occurs due to natural calamities or due to accidents, with these plans, you can immediately undertake repairs to the shop. \n\n✤ Office Insurance - Another type of property insurance policy, office insurance ensures that the office building and all the equipment inside are significantly protected in the event of unforeseen events. Generally, office spaces include expensive equipment, such as computers, servers and much more. Thus, availing these plans is essential. \n\n✤ Building Insurance - If you own a complete building, opting for home insurance may not be sufficient. Instead, you can purchase building insurance to cover the entire premises. \n\n✤ Benefits of Property Insurance \n\n✤ If you still think that property cover is not one of the types of insurance plans you need to avail, take a look at some of the advantages from the same. \n\n✤ Protection against Fires - While the insurance policy cannot prevent fires, it can prevent financial liabilities from such an event. \n\n✤ Burglaries - If your property exists in an area prone to theft and burglaries, such a policy is vital to ensure financial security. \n\n✤ Floods - In certain parts of India, floods are common. These floods can ravage your property leading to substantial losses. Property insurance also protects against such events. \n\n✤ Natural Calamities - The plan also offers financial aid against damage arising from earthquakes, storms and more. \n\n✤ Rebuilding or renovation of a property is immensely expensive.
